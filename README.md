This article presents a new bidirectional teleportation (BQT) protocol for an arbitrary number of qubits which employs 2n entangled Bell-states as the quantum channel. In the proposed scheme, Alice intends to transmit an arbitrary unknown qubit state to Bob, and vice versa. For establishing the protocol, n Bell-states are specified in the channel for each of the parties. By utilizing the Bell-states, input states are teleported over the channel by using Bell-basis measurements and applying a proper unitary operator. Thus, the communication purpose is achieved more privileged compared to recently presented protocols since the proposed protocol is simpler and uses the minimum resources. Furthermore, the circuit of the scheme is implemented in IBM Quantum experience platform using qasm_simulator and Qiskit library, and the outcomes verify the validation of the protocol. Moreover, the effect of the amplitude damping noise is analyzed and simulated using Qiskit.
